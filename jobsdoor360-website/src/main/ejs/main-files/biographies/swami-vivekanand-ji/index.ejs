      <h2>Questions & Reflections</h2>
  
      <div class="qa">
        <h3>Q: How could Swami Vivekananda leave his family in poverty? Was it right?</h3>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> It’s a morally difficult choice. After his father's death, Vivekananda did try to support his family but faced rejection and humiliation. Eventually, he chose the path of renunciation — not out of selfishness, but to serve a greater cause: the spiritual and social upliftment of all of India. Though he left physically, he ensured support for his mother later through his disciples and the Ramakrishna Mission. His decision reflects a balance between personal duty and higher calling.</p>
      </div>
  
      <div class="qa">
        <h3>Q: Did he completely abandon his family?</h3>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> No. He remained emotionally connected and arranged support for his mother. He encouraged disciples like Sister Nivedita to care for her and expressed guilt and concern for her well-being in his letters.</p>
      </div>
  
      <div class="qa">
        <h3>Q: What can we learn from this?</h3>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> His life teaches us about sacrifice, balance, and purpose. While personal responsibility is important, sometimes great individuals choose to serve a broader mission that ultimately benefits their families and many more.</p>
